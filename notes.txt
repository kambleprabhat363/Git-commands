.git - it's a git repository 
	. It contains history of each file and folder inside which folder it is present

git init - to get a ".git" folder

git status - see the current status what happened till last commit

________When we done editing the file we'll use______

Staging

git add . ( WE can use either specific file name or "." to get the all the files from the folder)

git log - to check the history 



Git reset <log_number> - it'll remove the history upto copy pasted log log_number
                        . The log number are connected to last commited section
                        . 

git log - it'll show the history of the commited folder

git restore <file_name> - 

Imagine you're working on project but whatever you've updated that you dont wanna add into that commited
there we'll use "git stash" 
    it'll hide those files which you have updated recently 
    and whenever you want those files back you'll use "git stash pop"


git stash - 
git stash pop -
--Note : .before doing 'git stash and pop' we have to do 'git add .'

If you don't need that update just use
git stash clear - to clear those hidden files

uploading our project to github

git remote add origin <url ending with .git>
 
git remote -v 
    ** It'll show the attached url to the folder


git push origin master
